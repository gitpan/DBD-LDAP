0.05  Mon Sep 17
	- Fixed "ldap_..." attributes to work, ie. "ldap_firstonly" did not work.
	  Also made "ldap_firstonly" to allow values > 1 to limit number of 
	  returned valued to that number.  Previously, =1 ment 1 value, =0 ment 
	  all values.
0.06  Fri Jun 27
	- Fixed Makefile.PL bug in Perl 5.8+ where make would fail with something 
	  like "Can't use string ("*.xsi") as a HASH ref...".  Thanks to everyone 
	  who reported this.
0.07	 Sun Mar 14 2004
	- Add compatability with Class::DBI and Netscape LDAP Server (added 
	  patches by jmorano per bug#12269 and 12270 in rt.cpan.org).  NOTE:  
	  Type VARCHAR is now 12 instead of -1.
0.08 	Wed Jul 19 2006
	- Stop appending base DN (2nd field in the table definition line) 
	  to the base insert attributes (5th field in the table definition line) 
	  per request / patch by R.K. Owen.  The attribute "ldap_appendbase2ins" 
	  was added for backward compatablility.  If set to 1, then pre-0.08 
	  behaviour is used.  I couldn't find a case where this was ever actually 
	  used, but if anyone needs it, then set this attribute in the "connect" 
	  call.  Default is zero (new behavior - no append).
